 - You can read the prompt of the system: [Read the prompt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehzPRJoRrdmy3Bu9h9BQk6_4Q18dNMt4Ukho_GGgyuQ/edit)
 
 - In this repo I put the synopsis of the software design process where
    <ul>
      <li>All classes are jotted down with respective attributes & methods</li>
      <li>Associations are displayed on the separate diagram</li>
    </ul>
    
 - Also there is a folder with code that transfers that design into something more tangible
